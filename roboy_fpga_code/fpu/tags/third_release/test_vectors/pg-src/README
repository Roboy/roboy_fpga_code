Building PG
===========

To build the floating point test pattern generator, you first need
to get a copy of the SoftFloat library from:

http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~jhauser/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html

Once installed, change directory to SoftFloat-2a/softfloat/bits32,
copy the included source file to this directory and compile
using a command like:

gcc -I386-Win32-gcc -opg.exe  fptpg.c softfloat.c

This build has been tested on SPARC Solaris systems and WIndows NT
with cygwin and gcc.
